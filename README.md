<h2>What do you usually do for this effect & what is the problem of this method?</h2>

- You enter the emoji

- Go to the seventh emoji point

- then you scroll and scroll down for a while
And then you finally find the emojis you need

- you click on some letter... and everything disappears. You can choose only one emoji letter at a time, if you want more, you need to repeat and repeat the actions described above all the time for one letter, so that little by little, like a turtle, you make the word you need, and what if you want to write a sentence? you will do it endlessly! That is why this generator was created.

<h1>What the settings do?</h1><img src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/891819752899629106/1006591460541476935/unknown.png">

They are only needed for people who have Discord Nitro. With the help of these settings, you can change the way emoji letters are generated. 

- For example, you can write animated letters.

- or write in cyrillic.

These emojis are not included in the standard Discord emojis, so we created separate servers and added our custom emojis there. Now, people who are members of these servers and have nitro can use this style of writing sentences with these emojis.

There is also a separate "settings" button, it shows a separate settings panel (so far empty), in the future it is planned to add additional settings there.

>To use all these settings, which are not included by default in discord, you have to remember to switch the "generator library"!<img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/891819752899629106/1006640993711431720/unknown.png">

>After changing the library, the settings buttons are unlocked<img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/891819752899629106/1006641657409716374/unknown.png">

>(For now, these servers with our own emojis are private. There is no way to get there at the moment, in the future they will be public, but for now you can only use this generator for emoji letters that are included in Discord emoji by default.)

>This is it. Good luck using it !
